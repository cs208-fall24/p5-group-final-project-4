## Experience

Wow, this one was a even more of a doozy. If I hadn’t had to deal with all of the crap that happened on Wednesday, all of my stuff would’ve been on time. But life happens, I suppose. This project was quite large, and I struggled the most with getting the comments to work. I couldn’t seem to get it to re-direct to the correct pages due to one reason or another. Most of the time I was simply missing a / somewhere. I also didn’t realize how much time the formatting was going to take me. But that’s partially my own fault for adding so many different things that I wanted to format differently. Pug wasn’t necessarily too much of an obstacle this time around, since we used it in Project 4. I’m really happy with how it turned out… sort of. I’m sure that my site will be seen as ugly, but it pleases my brain. I also realized that the way that I was handling some things were a bit more than I needed, but I think it’s cool. The two examples being the Add a Comment and Update Comment forms. I definitely didn’t need to animate them, nor did I need to create a whole new popup… But it was fun.
